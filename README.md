## Bingenow

Bingenow is an application to stream movies and tv shows for free. 
The streaming happens through a third-party service, so this application would be essentially an interface to consume the media.


## Techstack

Although the streaming service will be provided through a third party, to enchance the user experience,
this application will have its own backend to persist data like watchlist, watch history etc.

The following is the technologies that are being used in the project.

### Frontend:

- UI Library - React with typescript
- Authentication - Firebase
- State management and caching - React query
- Styling - TailwindCSS/MUI
- Build tool - webpack


### Backend:

- Server - Node.js with express (TypeScript)
- Database - MongoDB
- Hosting - Vercel for frontend, EC2 or lambda for backend(Suggestions are welcome)
- API - GraphQL


### Scope

This project is in a beginner stage with a room for lots of improvements, hence I'm looking for some help in maintaining the project, developing features, components and the UI. I believe the tech stack is pretty interesting and there's an amazing opportunity to learn and build great things here. 
If you're a beginner or an expert in the field of web development, there are numerous opportunities for everyone. I aim to keep this project more collaborative and fun. So, if you're a movie/series buff or a coding geek in general, and would like to build a platform to stream movies/tv shows for free, you should definitely consider contributing to this project.
