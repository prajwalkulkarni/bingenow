## Bingenow

Bingenow is an application to stream movies and tv shows for free.
The streaming happens through a third-party service, so this application would be essentially an interface to consume the media.

## Techstack

Although the streaming service will be provided through a third party, to enchance the user experience,
this application will have its own backend to persist data like watchlist, watch history etc.

The following are the technologies used.

### Frontend:

- UI Library - React with typescript
- State management and caching - React query
- Styling - TailwindCSS/MUI
- Build tool - webpack

### Backend:

- [Backend Repo](https://github.com/prajwalkulkarni/bingenow-be)
- Server - Node.js with express (TypeScript)
- Database - MongoDB
- API - GraphQL
- Authentication - Firebase

### Infra:

- Vercel for frontend
- AWS Lambda for backend
- AWS API Gateway

### Scope

This project is in a beginner stage with a room for lots of improvements, hence I'm looking for some help in maintaining the project, developing features, components and the UI. I believe the tech stack is pretty interesting and there's an amazing opportunity to learn and build great things here.
If you're a beginner or an expert in the field of web development, there are numerous opportunities for everyone. I aim to keep this project more collaborative and fun. So, if you're a movie/series buff or a coding geek in general, and would like to build a platform to stream movies/tv shows for free, fell free to contribute to this project.
